  - Add any number of columns ( embeddings, data, metadata)
  - Use your datasets to provide your LLM with accurate and relevant context
  - Use the data returned via the API to create rich UX's in your chat interface
  - You don't have to manage a vector database AND a regular database. It's all
    under one roof

- Document Management üìñ

  - We've added a ton of support for managing datasets with multiple documents
  - It's now extremely easy to replace vectors from an old document with content
    from new documents
  - You can now organize and return content based on the document id
  - Check out the [API reference](/api-reference/completions) for some more info

### **3/2/23 - Chat GPT API** üëÄ

#### OpenAI released the Chat GPT API, and we've added it Baseplate

- Go to the chat bubble from the top right of the playground to use our Chat GPT
  playground

- We've built in optimizations based on best practices to make your results
  better

<Warning>
  If you switch to using Chat GPT, the API structure for you endpoints will
  change too. Make sure to look at the API instructions for your endpoint before
  deploying!
</Warning>

### 2/24/23 - Introducing Baseplate for Teams

- **Your Team, One Workspace**

  - Your team's prompt Templates, Datasets, and Playground+ sessions are now
    shared!
  - You can now work together on tasks like prompt iteration, configuring
    semantic search, and more.
  - Never lose track of your teams historical data. Look back and see which
    variants are performing best.

- **Baseplate Endpoints**
  - Found a variant that works? Deploy to production with a single API call
  - A variant consists of a prompt, a data augmentation (semantic search)
    resource, and a LLM  
     \* By composing different combinations, you can quickly experiment and find
    the best strategy for your use case
  - Configure your connection to a Baseplate endpoint once in code, then never
    worry again. You can run experiments and deploy new variants to that
    endpoint from the console.

### 2/20/23 - Baseplate 0.2

- **Better Organization and Space Utilization. New Landing Page**

  - Some of you asked for us to make text boxes more readable and simplify our
    navigation
  - There is now one sidebar (which you can minimize), so you have more space to
    work
  - It's now much easier to read and compare prompts/completions
  - You also let us know that our web page didn't express the value of the
    product. Check out our latest version!

- **More Customized Embedding Support**

  - You can now choose a chunk size
  - You can now choose a "k" factor. This changes the number of search results
  - You can now choose any number of variables to use in your embedding search

- **Github Integration Alpha**

  - You can now add our Github app to your repo and keep your templates in code
    and Baseplate in sync
  - This integrates with popular prompt formats, like Langchain's serialization

- **Pricing Update**

  - The Starter tier is now $35 per seat
  - Teams looking to fine tune directly on the platform will need to upgrade to
    the Pro tier

- **Bug Fixes**
  - Way too many
