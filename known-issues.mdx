Embedding search can be out of sync if the number of rows do not match the
number of vectors in your dataset. In this case, the top K results may include
empty data/vectors, and will not show up in search results.

We are currently working on a way to fix this. In the mean time please reach out
to founders@trybaseplate.io.
