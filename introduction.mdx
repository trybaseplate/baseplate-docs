Baseplate is a backend optimized for LLM apps. Teams use our multimodal context
database to build rich user experiences with LLMs. All from an interface as
simple as a spreadsheet. That means you don't have to maintain and manage
separate databases for your vectors and regular data anymore!

Using Baseplate, a team can deploy a chat GPT app that responds with
domain-specific information from documents, thumbnails, links, images, and more.
(Who knows, maybe the next GPT model is multimodal too)

## Why would we need this?

In most applications, LLMs need to be connected to an ever changing set of data.
It‚Äôs simple enough to parse and embed a few PDF‚Äôs. However, managing this data
is tedious when you‚Äôre working with large, multimodal datasets that consistently
need to be updated, re-indexed, and replaced.

Plus you‚Äôre likely managing multiple databases - one for vectors, and one for
your other data. This gets painful really fast.

## Key Features:

1. A flexible hybrid database. A single dataset in Baseplate can contain
   - Embeddings
   - Text
   - Code
   - Documents
   - Images
   - Links
2. Database management
   - Sync datasets with your tools (Google Drive, S3, Box, Sharepoint, etc.)
   - Utilities for updating and managing vectors in bulk
   - Organize and segment your data intuitively
   - Work in the UI or programmatically via API
3. Smart Search
   - Choose an embedding model for your use case, tailored for your documents
   - Multi-step Search. Retrieve context from multiple datasets within an app.
   - Use keyword, semantic, or hybrid search
   - Retreive whole documents or just relevant chunks
4. App Builder
   - Choose between a number of popular LLMs
   - Build a custom prompt for your use case
   - Test and deploy your app without any code
5. Endpoints
   - One-click Slackbots, Discord Bots, Teams Bots, and more!
   - Build, test, and deploy your Apps via API endpoints
   - Unlimited queries
   - Built-in utilities for human feedback, logging, & caching
