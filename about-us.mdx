Andrew and Ani have been friends for over a decade. Before Baseplate, Andrew
worked at Google X, where he built backend infrastructure that handled TB’s of
data and connected LLMs to knowledge graphs. Ani was the Product Manager for
Logitech’s embedded Machine Learning platform, which he helped scale to millions
of conference rooms.
