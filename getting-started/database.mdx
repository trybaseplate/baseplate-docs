Instead of managing your data, a vector database, an embedding model, a search
algorithm, a PostgreSQL database, and your LLM all in different places...

What if you could do it in one spot, with your teammates?

## Create Columns

A Baseplate database is as flexible as a spreadsheet. You can create any number
of columns, and edit them directly from the UI.

1. Embedding Columns <br/> The content in these columns will be embedded using
   the embedding model you select
2. Data Columns <br/> Typically images, urls, code snippets, or links that you'd
   like to be returned with your search result
3. Metadata Columns <br/> Really useful for large datasets to make sure you're
   getting relevant vectors. Segment your data based on customer, datasource,
   version, date, or whatever your prefer!

## Adding Documents

1. Add a whole document <br/> You can use Baseplate's built in parsing
   capabilities to break documents into chunks for embedding. Specify a chunk
   size and which column to add the chunks to, and we'll do the rest
2. Add context chunk-by-chunk <br/> For more nuanced indices, upload rows to
   Baseplate via API once you've chunked them

## Updating Vectors

Edit your vectors from the interface or through the API. We'll automatically
handle the embedding, updating of your text representation, and upsert of the
new vector.

## Manage Documents

You can view, edit, replace, and delete your documents at once, instead of going
row-by-row. See our API for a guide on replacing old data.
