Navigate to the Apps tab to build reusable prompt templates that you can use in
multiple projects.

Apps take variables - e.g. a customer's name or question, and use them to format
a prompt. This creates a super flexible way to wrap unstructured user inputs in
prompts that you've designed.

Apps also use variables to find the right content from your Baseplate Database.

- Add Variables using the + button, or by pressing enter. Name the variable with
  a simple, one-word title if possible.
- Add your variables into your prompt template. This tells us where to put the
  user provided values by putting the name of each form field inside double
  curly brackets, e.g {{question}}.

## Add Search Functionality to Reference a Database

Apps need to search through your content database. When you click "Configure
Embedding Search" you'll see your search options.

This is where you can configure search to meet your specific use case.

1. Choose a database
2. Choose your search variables
3. Choose the number of vectors to returned
4. Choose a minimum similarity
5. Add metadata filters
6. Choose and optimize a hybrid search using both keywords and semantic search
   for the best results
