## Creating an API Key
You'll need an API key to use our APIs. Generate one, and use it in your codebase. You will only be able to see each API key once, but you can always generate more. 

## Adding Your API Keys for LLM Integrations
Only if you plan to use Baseplate for deploying your LLM App (Recommended)


Completions API usage is billed directly to your account with each LLM provider. If you reach your
account limit, have an issue with payments, or any other issue occurs, you will
need to resolve the issue with the LLM provider directly.
