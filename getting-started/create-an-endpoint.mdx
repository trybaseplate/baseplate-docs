<Tip>
  You can deploy LLM backends directly from Baseplate. Set up an endpoint once
  in your code, and you're good to go!
</Tip>

The worst part of prototyping great LLM apps is having to reimplement them again
in your codebase. Baseplate Endpoints makes sure you never have to do that
again!

Each endpoint has an ID that you will use as a reference in your code.

## Why do it this way?

- Prototyping in code is slow, difficult, and annoying. Setting up new versions
  in a nice UI can speed up workflows greatly
- Easy to run tests and experiments different variants
- Monitor and manage in a single place
- Our endpoints are performance optimized and run on the edge

## Create an Endpoint

Go to the Endpoints page and create an Endpoint.

## Variants

Variants are versions of your LLM application. They are composable units that
can be hot-swapped with each other.

A variant consists of:

- An LLM (a foundation model or a fine tuned model)
- A Prompt Template
- (Optional) An external data source. See Semantic Search for more info.

Create multiple variants to experiment and improve your results.
