You can Train or Import Fine Tuned models into Baseplate. Training is only
available in the Team and Enterprise tiers.

Choose a Template that your Fine Tune will be based on. Then choose a Dataset.
The variables in the Template will be matched against the Columns of your
dataset to automatically format your training data.

This allows you to test different datasets and templates without having to
manually reformat your data.

Once you've fine tuned a model, it can be used everywhere in Baseplate.
